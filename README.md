# Pollutant-Index-Classification

# Project Description:
Air Pollution Standards are numbers that do not have specific units that are used to describe air quality conditions in a particular location, taking into the impact on human health, aesthetic value and other ecosystems.

For this project, our goal was to create a machine learning model to classify pollution indices, focusing on various causal factors.

# Data Overview
The pollutant-standards-index-southtangerang-2020-2022 contains air pollution measurements, such as Particulate Matter (PM10), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), and Natrium Dioxide (NO2). The measurement has been converted to pollutant standards index (PSI) or Indeks Standar Pencemaran Udara (ISPU)

Attribute Information

Date - Date of measurements
PM10 - Particulate Matter measurements
SO2 - Sulfur Dioxide measurements
CO - Carbon Monoxide measurements
O3 - Ozone measurements
NO2 - Natrium DIoxide measurements
Max - The highest measurement value
Critical Component - Component(s) that has the highest measurement value
Category - Category of air pollution, whether it's good or not
